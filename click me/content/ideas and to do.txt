Button ideas
    * shuffle - moves all buttons to new random spots
    * a button that hides waldo or sumn idk
    * a 'corrupted' button that streams colors across the screen
    * button to change the color of buttons
    * button to change the size of buttons
    * a button that screams (maybe it could say "dont click me") huh? that could be clever

things that need fixing:
    * fucking uh that exploding one in the circle, yeah bro get that together
    * thanos snap should make a snap sound
    *
